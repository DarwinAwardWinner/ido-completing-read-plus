;;; Commentary:

;; You may have seen the `ido-everywhere' variable in ido.el and got
;; excited that you could use ido completion for everything. Then you
;; were probably disappointed when you realized that it only applied
;; to *file names* and nothing else. Well, ido-ubiquitous is here to
;; fulfill the original promise and let you use ido completion for
;; (almost) any command that uses `completing-read' to offer you a
;; choice of several alternatives.

;; This even works in M-x, but for that, you might prefer the "smex"
;; package instead.

  function to use the original completing read by using the macro
  `ido-ubiquitous-disable-in'. For example, if a
