	* Eliminate use of "macroexp--backtrace", which doesn't exist in
	Emacs 24.2.

2013-09-11  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* Fix handling of collection being a function (issues #23 and
	#25).

	* Fix the issue where `called-interactively-p' always returns
	false

	* Ido-ubiquitous now works better with interactive
	commands. Specifically, it now works when the completion happens
	inside the "interactive" form of the command instead of the
	function body.

	* Functions and commands that need non-standard behavior are now
	controlled through the variables
	"ido-ubiquitous-command-overrides" and
	"ido-ubiquitous-function-overrides".

	* Major rewrite of a significant portions of ido-ubiquitous.

2013-05-31  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* Officially drop support for Emacs 23 and lower. ido-ubiquitous
	now uses the `completing-read-function' variable instead of
	advising `completing-read'.

	* Make ido-ubiquitous work more reliably in interactive commands.

	* Avoid spurious warning when loaded before ido.

	* Disable ido when completion-extra-properties is non-nil

	* The interface for setting old-style completion compatibility has
	changed. If you have customized these settings, you should review
	them after upgrading.

2012-09-07  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* Restore compatibility with Emacs 23 and earlier

	* Work around an ido bug where providing both an initial input and
	a default would break things

	* Most modifications to ido behavior are now activated only when
	ido is acting as a completing-read replacement, and not when it is
	used directly. This shoud prevent ido-ubiquitous from interfering
	with normal usage of ido.

	* Add Custom interface for compatibility exceptions.

2012-09-03  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* New implementation: Switch from defining advice on
	"completing-read" to setting "completing-read-function"
