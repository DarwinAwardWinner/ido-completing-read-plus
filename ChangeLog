	behavior are now controlled through the variables
	"ido-ubiquitous-command-overrides" and

	* ido-ubiquitous: Restore compatibility with Emacs 23 and earlier

	* ido-ubiquitous: Work around an ido bug where providing both an
	initial input and a default would break things

	* ido-ubiquitous: Most modifications to ido behavior are now
	activated only when ido is acting as a completing-read
	replacement, and not when it is used directly. This shoud prevent
	ido-ubiquitous from interfering with normal usage of ido.

	exceptions.

2012-09-03  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>
