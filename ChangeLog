2017-06-01  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-completing-read+.el (ido-completing-read+): Don't use ido if
	the collection is empty, since doing so would be pointless.

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (ido-ubiquitous-default-command-overrides):
	Update some overrides

	* ido-describe-fns.el (ido-descfns-maybe-load-prefixes): Add
	support for the auto-loading feature of describe-variable and
	similar commands.

2017-03-13  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (ido-cr+--explain-fallback): Fix
	ido-ubiquitous-debug-mode messages.

2016-06-23  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (ido-ubiquitous-default-command-overrides):
	Remove the recently-added overrides for "describe-function" and
	"describe-variable". Ido completion interferes with a new feature
	of the completion for these functions, so it should be disabled
	unless ido can be made compatible with this feature.

2016-06-18  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (completing-read-ido-ubiquitous): Fix an edge
	case where COLLECTION is a function and PREDICATE is non-nil. This
	edge case caused errors in "describe-function" and
	"describe-variable" in Emacs 25.1.
	(completing-read-ido-ubiquitous): Make error handling more robust.
	In addition to falling back to normal completion on a specific set
	of expected errors, ido-ubiquitous now falls back on *any* error
	encountered in the body of "completing-read-ido-ubiquitous".
	(ido-ubiquitous-default-command-overrides): Add override for
	"describe-function" and "describe-variable", which now require
	them in Emacs 25.1.

2016-02-20  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-completing-read+.el (ido-select-text): Eliminate another
	compiler warning

2016-02-17  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* test/ido-ubiquitous-test.el: Significant refactoring of awkward
	testing code. Tests should now be more robust.

	* ido-completing-read+.el (ido-select-text): Fix an edge case in
	ido-select-text: when require-match and default are both non-nil,
	it should be impossible to return an empty string.
	(ido-cr+-fallback-function): Don't allow ido-ubiquitous to be a
	fallback for ido-cr+.

2016-01-29  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (ido-ubiquitous--maybe-update-overrides):
	Change default auto-update setting to notify. If the user has
	customized overrides and new ones are added upstream, it will nag
	them until they choose to explicitly enable or disable
	auto-updating.

2016-01-16  Rasmus <rasmus@gmx.us>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (ido-ubiquitous-update-overrides): Remove
	dependency on s.el.

2015-11-22  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (ido-ubiquitous--maybe-update-overrides):
	Allow ido-ubiquitous to automatically add new overrides.

	* ido-ubiquitous.el: Fix up dependency declarations and require
	statements (including a pull request by Steve Purcell)

	require-match is enabled

	* ido-ubiquitous.el: Add override for etags-select

2015-06-19  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el: Fix some byte-compile warnings in autoloads
	by also autoloading the associated variable declarations

2015-06-18  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el: Ignore and warn about invalid overrides
	instead of crashing

	* ido-completing-read+.el: Fix some variable declaration warnings

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (ido-ubiquitous-default-command-overrides):
	Add override for "where-is" command

2015-05-28  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el (ido-ubiquitous-version): Fix a typo in the previous version

2015-04-23  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-completing-read+.el: Fix obsolete reference to "choices"
	instead of "collection"

2015-04-08  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous.el: Major refactor. Split into two packages:
	ido-completing-read+.el and ido-ubiquitous.el that depends on it.
	Additionally, some of the customization variables for
	ido-ubiquitous have been changed for increased flexibility in
	configuration, and the internals have been rearchitected
	significantly.

2015-01-25  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	(pre-24.4)

	* ido-ubiquitous: Implement collection function whitelist

	* ido-ubiquitous: Implement collection size limit for ido

	always returns false
	https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/ido-ubiquitous/issues/24

2013-09-05  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous: Ido-ubiquitous now works better with interactive
	commands. Specifically, it now works when the completion happens
	inside the "interactive" form of the command instead of the
	function body.

	* ido-ubiquitous: Functions and commands that need non-standard
	behavior are now controlled through the variables
	"ido-ubiquitous-command-overrides" and
	"ido-ubiquitous-function-overrides".

	* ido-ubiquitous: Major rewrite of a significant portions of
	ido-ubiquitous.

2013-05-31  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	instead of advising `completing-read'.

	* ido-ubiquitous: Make ido-ubiquitous work more reliably in
	interactive commands.

	* ido-ubiquitous: Avoid spurious warning when loaded before ido.

	* ido-ubiquitous: Disable ido when completion-extra-properties is
	non-nil

	* ido-ubiquitous: The interface for setting old-style completion
	compatibility has changed. If you have customized these settings,
	you should review them after upgrading.

2012-09-07  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>

	* ido-ubiquitous: Restore compatibility with Emacs 23 and earlier

	* ido-ubiquitous: Work around an ido bug where providing both an
	initial input and a default would break things

	* ido-ubiquitous: Most modifications to ido behavior are now
	activated only when ido is acting as a completing-read
	replacement, and not when it is used directly. This shoud prevent
	ido-ubiquitous from interfering with normal usage of ido.

	* ido-ubiquitous: Add Custom interface for compatibility
	exceptions.

2012-09-03  Ryan C. Thompson  <rct@thompsonclan.org>
